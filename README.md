# Grade Management  
This is a basic grade management system for students.  

It allows the user to add years, semesters, and classes, each represented as an object.  

Additionally, it provides functionality to calculate the minimum and maximum grades, determine the average, and identify exams that need to be retakenâ€”across all years, a specific year, or a semester within a year.  

## Features

### ðŸ”¹ Academic Structure Management
